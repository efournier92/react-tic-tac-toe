# React Tic Toe

## Challenge
- The goal is to create a functioning [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game.
- The game should work as follows:
  1. The 1st player places an `X` anywhere on the board by clicking a square.
  1. The 2nd player places an `O` on the board.
  1. The game continues to alternate this way after each turn.
- Implement a function to determine if any player won by getting 3 `X`s or 3 `O`s diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.
- If there is a winner, display a message at the top indicating who won.
  - If nobody has yet won, then do not display any message.
- Implement a function to reset the entire game board.
- Ensure one player cannot override the other player's move during the game.
